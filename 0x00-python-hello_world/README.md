This is my first day learning Python with the alx crew.

The first project I got was to create a shell file that runs a python script and prints the results onto the console. It was pretty basic, but drilled some previous knowledge of bash scripts into my head, like the chmod command(which I almost forgot about, and was confused when I ran the python filename (without the .py extension will not work) command).
