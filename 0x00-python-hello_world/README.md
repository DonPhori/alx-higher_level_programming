This is my first day learning Python with the alx crew.

N.B when writing a shell script that will run Python scripts or code, always export the python variable!!!

The first project I got was to create a shell file that runs a python script and prints the results onto the console. It was pretty basic, but drilled some previous knowledge of bash scripts into my head, like the chmod command(which I almost forgot about, and was confused when I ran the python filename (without the .py extension will not work) command).

When running python code from a shell script, it is imperative that I use the ( <<< ) sign, to tell the script from whichvariable I am referring to.

When writing a python script, always include the #!/usr/bin/python3 path. The python command is not installed on my webterm, so the script needs to include this path for it to run.

f strings are used for string formating, where I can insert a variable inside a placeholder. f string (formating string).
